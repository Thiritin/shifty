# Shifty - Shift Planning Application

This Laravel 12 application provides a simple shift planning tool for teams. Users can view shifts, assign themselves to shifts, and track their progress. The application features a dog that changes mood based on shift performance!

## Features

- **User Dashboard**: View personal shift performance with a mood-based dog indicator
- **Shift Planning**: Weekly view of all shifts with easy assignment/unassignment
- **Admin Panel**: Admin users can create/edit shifts and manage user assignments
- **Printable Schedule**: Generate PDF-ready shift schedules
- **User Management**: Admins can set expected shifts per user and admin permissions

## Database Setup

The application is already configured with SQLite. To set up the database:

1. **Run Migrations** (if needed):
```bash
php migrate.php
```

2. **Seed Test Data**:
```bash
php seed.php
```

This creates:
- Admin user: admin@example.com (password: password)
- 4 test users with various shift expectations
- Sample shifts for the current week
- Random shift assignments

## Frontend Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

```
